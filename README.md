# Practical Object Oriented Design With Ruby (by Sandy Metz), in Python 3

## Sample code from this excellent book translated to Python 3.

This repo is an adaptation to Python 3 of the samples of the book, chapter by chapter except 1, 4 and 5 are they illustrate concepts that don't need
to be translated in my humble opinion.

The book is available [here](http://www.sandimetz.com/products/) and I strongly recommend reading it as gives a great insight in OOP in a pragmatic way.

## How to run the code

To run code from a chapter, in Linux,

```
python3 ch02/Gear01.js
```
